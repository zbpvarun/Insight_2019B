About this Resource:
HospFinder is a free service that provides a list of hospitals in the US searchable by ZIP code and rankable by user input weights of various factors including major and minor complications. However, HospFinder makes explicit the following limitations of the data and information provided: \n
\n
1. The complication rates used here are from the rates reported to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for the year of 2017. \n
2. The complication rates generally apply to rates across the hospital and not to the specific departments being searched for. \n
3. The units for the complication rates are average number of occurrences per 30 days. \n
4. Some rates of complications are blank as these hospitals either did not have enough procedures to compute a reliable average or did not report them. In such cases, the ranking alogorithm assigns the value of the national average. \n
5. The distance of each hospital is calculated from the center of the ZIP code location to the hospital "as the bird flies" and does not take travel routes into account. \n
6. The only hospitals present in this database are hospitals that accept Medicare payments and so, pediatric departments are likely to be underrepresented. \n
\n
Limitation of HospFinder Liabilities: \n
\n
HospFinder does not warrant, whether expressed or implied, that the ranking algorithm is accurate or complete. HospFinder does not recommend or endorse any hospital included in the alogorithm for any purpose, nor is the algorithm a tool to verify a specific hospital's success or failure rates. It is your responsibility to select a hospital appropriate for your needs and you assume full responsibility for all subsequent interactions with any hospital you contact following use of the algorithm. HospFinder is not responsible for the quality of care at any hospital you choose to contact.
